'I'll add JWTs and state-management into the mix'. Better start learning Redux! After a few days of banging my head against the wall with Redux, I decided to step back and determine my motivations for learning all of these things at once. Did I actually need all of this?

I've concluded that, for now, I'll stick to the tried-and-true method of creating a tradition server-side rendering website. I'm sticking with my guns and learning Django in bite-sized chunks. Over the last two weeks it's been alot easier to handle.
